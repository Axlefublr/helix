# Setting expectations

This is, for the most part, a strictly personal fork.

**I will arbitrarily add breaking changes**, either to the changes already made by this fork, or to core. \
Autoupdating this fork is a bad idea, consequently. \
Instead, check what changed from time to time (the contents of this readme) to decide when you want to update.

The commits don't reflect the *history* of changes I've made, \
they are a series of patches I apply *on top* of helix master. \
Whenever I make some change, I will either amend (edit) an already existing relevant commit, or add a new one, not necessarily as the latest commit. You can notice how changes are grouped by category, in the commits of the fork. \
Some of my changes will seem crazy to you ‚Äî drop the commits with changes you dislike, before building this fork.

I rebase on master every time I see a new feature I want from it. \
Every time I rebase, or make some other significant change, I'll create a backup branch that I will also push to this repo. \
I make a backup branch after confirming all my new changes work, and stop updating the previous backup branch. \
I'll keep updating the now current backup branch for changes that are small. On the next big change, I create the next backup branch, and stop updating the current one.

They're meant as a safeguard for me if something goes wrong, but also can be used by you to extract a feature that you like, that I happened to delete.

# Installation

To use this fork, you would have to build this repository from source.

First, `cd` into some place where you would like to keep this repository, so that you can easily update in the future. \
I recommend to also [read the docs](https://docs.helix-editor.com/master/building-from-source.html) on compiling helix from source, to make sure everything goes smoothly. \
Then, execute this in your (linux) shell:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Axlefublr/helix
cd helix
cargo install --path helix-term --locked
mkdir -p ~/.cargo/bin/
rm -fr ~/.cargo/bin/runtime
ln -sf $PWD/runtime ~/.cargo/bin/
```

Because I make a symlink, the runtime directory that helix requires gets updated automatically. \
When files in the `runtime/` directory of this repository (your locally stored copy) change, they change in the place where helix expects them, too.

To make sure the locations match up, see the output of `helix --health`.

The full path to the binary you'll get is `~/.cargo/bin/hx`, so you will be able to use `hx` in your shell if `~/.cargo/bin` is in your $PATH (it likely already is). \
The `helix` package on arch actually gives you the executable `helix`, rather than `hx`. Here you will get `hx` even if you are on arch.

In the future, when you want to update, you would:

```sh
git pull
cargo install --path helix-term --locked
```

Big shoutout to these people!

## Treesitter queries

Markdown no longer highlights indented codeblocks as (unlanguaged) codeblocks. \
This makes more sense in context: I forked the markdown treesitter parser to completely remove the concept of indented codeblocks, because it's ridiculously stupid! \
With it, you'll be able to indent your markdown however much you want, without things turning yellow (or whatever your codeblocks look like) *and* re-enabling highlighting for everything else as well.

Put the following in your languages.toml, then run `hx -g fetch ; hx -g build` if you want that for yourself:
```toml
[[grammar]]
name = "markdown"
source = { git = "https://github.com/Axlefublr/tree-sitter-markdown", rev = "576386d4068f3c04c87ffcd47c64850eeddf7f6e", subpath = "tree-sitter-markdown" }
```

## Defaults

Tab width 4 -> 3. \
This only applies to the `text` filetype, and only if helix didn't notice a different indentation from the context of the file.

All pickers now take up the entire screen, rather than 90%. \
Thanks to @satoqz for figuring out how to do this! :D

In default helix, there's one space on each side of each buffer name in the bufferline. \
So the first buffer's ending space and the second buffer's starting space ends up being 2 spaces together. \
This means that there's this awkward space before the entire bufferline, instead of being flush with the absolute left of the editor. \
This change places *two* spaces *after* each buffer, making the 2-sized gap still remain, but without the awkward leading space. \
`justify-content: space-between` rather than `space-around`, basically.

Also, the index of each buffer is shown before the filename, in the bufferline.

## Behavior

`indent` action now works even on empty lines.

The `scrolloff` option is applied only vertically, not also horizontally.

On write, the contents of the buffer are piped into `helix-piper`¬π and are replaced with its output¬≤. \
You're meant to have `helix-piper` as a symlink to some formatter binary that you want to run for *everything*. \
Unfortunately helix doesn't have a way to:
1. set a formatter for every language
2. set more than one formatter for a given language
3. set a formatter (or lsp) for the default, "text" language

So this is why I came up with this workaround. \
Beware: due to implementation details, std**err** is considered valid output. \
If your formatter prints an error to stderr, you'll end up seeing your entire buffer replaced with that error message. \
This can be destructive if you use `:write-all` while not looking at that buffer, and then close helix without realizing you demolished some buffer. Food for thought.

If you're not sure how this can be useful to you, but are excited about the possibilities, check out [my blog post](https://axlefublr.github.io/consider-sorting/) on how I automatically sort *sections* of some files.

¬π If you have it in `$PATH`

¬≤ If that output is different from the input text. If the input and output are the same, the document doesn't get touched. \
**Unless** the document is "too large". Don't ask me! I don't know either! This optimization comes from the issue of doing a nothing burger write on scratch / empty buffers; if it happens to help other cases that's cool too but ultimately not the main goal. \
But if you're genuinely interested in the implementation detail, "too large" happens when the string of the document isn't laid out in contiguous memory. Which I can't imagine being practically applicable information üëç

## Hardcoded mappings

Hover docs, pickers, and possibly other various popups have <kbd>ctrl+d</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl+u</kbd> hardcoded to mean "scroll by half a page down / up" \
I remove them because <kbd>ctrl+u</kbd> overrides the very useful "delete until the start of the line" mapping. \
Not being able to delete the entire text in a picker at once is very painful. \
You can use <kbd>PageDown</kbd> and <kbd>PageUp</kbd> instead.

### prompts (command mode, pickers, etc)

<kbd>ctrl+v</kbd> pastes the contents of your `default-yank-register`. A shortcut to <kbd>ctrl+r "</kbd>, basically.

### pickers

Due to <kbd>ctrl+v</kbd> now pasting, the hotkey to open the result in a vertial split is moved from <kbd>ctrl+v</kbd> to <kbd>ctrl+m</kbd>.

By default, <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> jump to the first / last result, in the list of results. \
This once again overshadows very useful hotkeys, that let you go to the start/end of the line (your picker input) :/ \
Now, <kbd>ctrl+Home</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl+End</kbd> are used instead.

### textobjects

In `select_textobject_around` (<kbd>ma</kbd>) and `select_textobject_inner` (<kbd>mi</kbd>) specifically.

Add alias `l` for paragraph, keeping the default `p` as well, and alias `o` for big WORD, keeping the default `W` as well.

## New commands

`:random` randomizes the order of your selections. Has aliases `:rnd`, `:rng`.

`:echopy` command is exactly like `:echo`, but *also* puts the result into your `default-yank-register`. Has alias `:cc`.

`:buffer-delete-file` (with aliases `db`, `del`, `delete`) deletes the *current* buffer's real file, and also forcefully closes the buffer. You can think of it as `:sh rm %{buffer_name}` + `:buffer-close!` in a single command.

`:buffer-nth` (with alias `bi`) lets you travel to the nth buffer, out of those you have open currently. The `-r` flag counts buffers from the end, rather than from the start. \
Reason why I didn't make it just use negative numbers, is because they are attempted to be interpreted as flags, and so you have to do `-- -1`. `-r 1` is slightly nicer.

## New actions (except [harp](#harp-integration))

`count_selections` tells you how many selections you have. Only really useful if you disable the statusline.

`toggle_line_select` does `trim_selections` if any of your selections end in a newline, while not *all* of them being single column selections that only contain a newline. \
If all of your selections are single column selections that are all newlines, or some of your selections don't end in a newline, does `extend_to_line_bounds`. \
A bit of a confusing definition, but in effect this means that this action will try its best to expand all of your selections to the whole line, and will only `trim_selections` when all of your selections are whole line selections. \
The whole "single column selections that are newlines" business is needed to handle the case where you position your cursor on a newline, while intending to select that entire line.

`surround_add_tag` prompts you with the name of an html tag, and surrounds your selections with it. \
You have `word`, type in `div`, and get `<div>word</div>`. \
The history for it is stored in the `<` register.

## New options

All are in the `[editor]` section.

`whichkey` can be set to `true` (default) or `false`. \
If set to `false`, the infoboxes for *mappings* will not show up. \
This is different from just disabling the `auto-info` option in that you will still get the popup for `select_register`.

`should-statusline` can be set to `false` to disable the statusline. \
This exists because in default helix, even if you have no statusline elements in your statusline configuration, a default set of elements is drawn, rather than removing the statusline. \
This option is designed to be disabled in your config, but you can change it on runtime as well. \
It will look wonky if you do, so it makes the most sense to make a hotkey to toggle the statusline for when you need it.

`disable-dot-repeat` disables the hardcoded behavior of `.` to repeat the previous operation, letting you map `.` to something else. \
Keep in mind, with this option turned on, you lose the ability to dot-repeat, as you can't map something else to do dot-repeat.

`show-diagnostics` is set to `true` by default. \
Exists because you can't actually toggle diagnostics globally otherwise.

`harp` subsection, that will be explained in the harp section below.

## Extra command expansions

Considering our example context...

|Thing                    |Value                                            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|current buffer           |`~/prog/dotfiles/fish/abbreviations/percent.fish`|
|current working directory|`~/prog/dotfiles`                                |

...here's what the added command expansions would evaluate to:

|Expansion             |Output                                           |Explanation                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|`%{full_path}`        |`~/prog/dotfiles/fish/abbreviations/percent.fish`|full path|
|`%{relative_path}`    |`fish/abbreviations/percent.fish`                |buffer path, relative to current working directory|
|`%{buffer_parent}`    |`~/prog/dotfiles/fish/abbreviations`             |parent directory of the current buffer

> [!CAUTION]
> The path evaluates to have `~`, instead of `/home/username` \
> This is because paths starting with `~` are accepted everywhere in helix, and when used in your shell (like with `:sh`), will be expanded as well. \
> But, in the rare case where it doesn't expand, beware of this behavior. \
> I'm taking this tradeoff to see `~/r/dot` instead of `/home/axlefublr/r/dot` in my various mappings that `:echo` expanded paths.

## Harp integration

[My blog post on harp](https://axlefublr.github.io/harp/) is the most complete explanation of the idea and feature. \
The following expects you to have read the blog post.

### File harps

```
harp_file
```

`set` takes the *current buffer*'s filepath, and stores it in a harp. \
`get` takes it, and `:open`s it.

### Relative file harps

```
harp_relative_file
```

`set` takes the current buffer's filepath, and stores it in a harp. \
HOWEVER, it stores only the part of the full path, that's relative to current working directory.

Say your current buffer path is `~/prog/dotfiles/colors.css` and your current working directory is `~/prog/dotfiles`. \
If you use a normal [file harp](#file-harps), you will store the full path: `~/prog/dotfiles/colors.css`. \
If you use a *relative* file harp, you will store the *relative* path: `colors.css`.

So then, the `get` action will just open that path relatively ‚Äî as if you did `:open colors.css`. This will end up opening a different file depending on your current working directory.

### Cwd harps

```
harp_cwd
```

`set` stores your current working directory in a harp. \
`get` `:cd`s into a stored working directory.

### Search harps

```
harp_search
```

`set` takes your latest search pattern from register `/` and stores it in a harp. \
`get` takes a stored search pattern, and puts it back into register `/`, effectively "making a search".

### Mark harps

```
harp_mark
```

`set` takes the path to the current buffer, and your primary selection's cursor position, and stores it as [file, line, column]. \
`get` takes the stored file and opens it. Then, takes the remaining [line, column] and puts your cursor into that position.

Basically like vim's marks.

### Register harps

```
harp_register
```

`set` puts the contents of your default register (`"` by default, decided by `default-yank-register` option) into a harp. \
`get` puts the stored text back into your default register

If you use `set` while having multiple selections, they are joined into a single one with newlines.

### Command harps

```
harp_command
```

`set` puts your most recent command mode command (register `:`) into a harp. \
`get` executes a stored command mode command and writes it to the `:` register.

Supports command expansions! :3

### Relativity

When you use any harp action, you will see `(global)` to the right of the prompt. \
The word in the brackets shows you the currently active relativity, and `global` is the default relativity for all harp actions.

Press <kbd>.</kbd> to make the harp relative to your current working directory. \
Press <kbd>,</kbd> to make it relative to the current buffer. \
Press <kbd>;</kbd> to make it relative to the current buffer's filetype (run `:lang` to check the filetype of the current buffer). \
Press <kbd>'</kbd> to go back to global relativity.

You can press these keys to change relativity as many times as you need, until you press a different key, that will be *actually* interpreted, using the relativity you ended up arriving to. \
Alternatively, you can press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to cancel the harp action.

You can change the assumed relativity per harp action.

The default config is the following:
```toml
[editor.harp]
command = 'global'
cwd = 'global'
file = 'global'
register = 'global'
relative_file = 'global'
search = 'global'
```

As you can see, all harp actions use the `global` relativity by default. \
The other values you could use instead are: `buffer`, `directory`, `filetype`.

A [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) / [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of Kakoune's design decisions.

For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

# Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

Although it's primarily a terminal-based editor, I am interested in exploring
a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) using wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/<lang>/` for `indents.scm`.
